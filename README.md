# terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision [Auto Scaling Group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html) and [Launch Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) on AWS.

The module also creates AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `"false"`.

| metrics_granularity | The granularity to associate with the metrics to collect. The only valid value is 1Minute | string | `1Minute` | no |

A positive increment adds to the current capacity and a negative value removes from the current capacity | string | `-1` | no |
| scale_up_adjustment_type | Specifies whether the adjustment is an absolute number or a percentage of the current capacity. Valid values are `ChangeInCapacity`, `ExactCapacity` and `PercentChangeInCapacity` | string | `ChangeInCapacity` | no |
