# terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision [Auto Scaling Group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html) and [Launch Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) on AWS.

The module also creates AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `"false"`.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group/releases).
