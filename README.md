Terraform module to provision [Auto Scaling Group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html) and [Launch Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) on AWS.

The module also creates AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `false`.

At present, although you can set the created AutoScaling Policy type to any legal value, in practice [only `SimpleScaling` is supported](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group/issues/55).
To use a `StepScaling` or `TargetTrackingScaling` policy, create it yourself and then pass it in the `alarm_actions` field of `custom_alarms`.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage


```hcl
locals {
  userdata = <<-USERDATA
    #!/bin/bash
    cat <<"__EOF__" > /home/ec2-user/.ssh/config
    Host *
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
    __EOF__
    chmod 600 /home/ec2-user/.ssh/config
    chown ec2-user:ec2-user /home/ec2-user/.ssh/config
  USERDATA
}

module "autoscale_group" {
  source = "cloudposse/ec2-autoscale-group/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  namespace   = var.namespace
  stage       = var.stage
  environment = var.environment
  name        = var.name

  image_id                    = "ami-08cab282f9979fc7a"
  instance_type               = "t2.small"
  security_group_ids          = ["sg-xxxxxxxx"]
  subnet_ids                  = ["subnet-xxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyy", "subnet-zzzzzzzz"]
  health_check_type           = "EC2"
  min_size                    = 2
  max_size                    = 3
  wait_for_capacity_timeout   = "5m"
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  user_data_base64            = base64encode(local.userdata)

  # All inputs to `block_device_mappings` have to be defined
  block_device_mappings = [
    {
      device_name  = "/dev/sda1"
      no_device    = "false"
      virtual_name = "root"
      ebs = {
        encrypted             = true
        volume_size           = 200
        delete_on_termination = true
        iops                  = null
        kms_key_id            = null
        snapshot_id           = null
        volume_type           = "standard"
      }
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Tier              = "1"
    KubernetesCluster = "us-west-2.testing.cloudposse.co"
  }

  # Auto-scaling policies and CloudWatch metric alarms
  autoscaling_policies_enabled           = true
  cpu_utilization_high_threshold_percent = "70"
  cpu_utilization_low_threshold_percent  = "20"
}
```

To enable custom_alerts the map needs to be defined like so :
```hlc
alarms = {
    alb_scale_up = {
      alarm_name                = "${module.default_label.id}-alb-target-response-time-for-scale-up"
      comparison_operator       = "GreaterThanThreshold"
      evaluation_periods        = var.alb_target_group_alarms_evaluation_periods
      metric_name               = "TargetResponseTime"
      namespace                 = "AWS/ApplicationELB"
      period                    = var.alb_target_group_alarms_period
      statistic                 = "Average"
      threshold                 = var.alb_target_group_alarms_response_time_max_threshold
      dimensions_name           = "LoadBalancer"
      dimensions_target         = data.alb.arn_suffix
      treat_missing_data        = "missing"
      ok_actions                = var.alb_target_group_alarms_ok_actions
      insufficient_data_actions = var.alb_target_group_alarms_insufficient_data_actions
      alarm_description         = "ALB Target response time is over ${var.alb_target_group_alarms_response_time_max_threshold} for more than ${var.alb_target_group_alarms_period}"
      alarm_actions             = [module.autoscaling.scale_up_policy_arn]
    }
}
```
All those keys are required to be there so if the alarm you are setting does not requiere one or more keys you can just set to empty but do not remove the keys otherwise you could get a weird merge error due to the maps being of different sizes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
