# terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d8b7d3d4cba337a81a18256) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision [Auto Scaling Group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html) and [Launch Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) on AWS.

The module also creates AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `"false"`.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-autoscale-group/releases).

A positive increment adds to the current capacity and a negative value removes from the current capacity | number | `-1` | no |
| scale_up_adjustment_type | Specifies whether the adjustment is an absolute number or a percentage of the current capacity. Valid values are `ChangeInCapacity`, `ExactCapacity` and `PercentChangeInCapacity` | string | `ChangeInCapacity` | no |

The allowed values are `Launch`, `Terminate`, `HealthCheck`, `ReplaceUnhealthy`, `AZRebalance`, `AlarmNotification`, `ScheduledActions`, `AddToLoadBalancer`.

| target_group_arns | A list of aws_alb_target_group ARNs, for use with Application Load Balancing | list(string) | `<list>` | no |

| wait_for_capacity_timeout | A maximum duration that Terraform should wait for ASG instances to be healthy before timing out. Setting this to '0' causes Terraform to skip all Capacity Waiting behavior | string | `10m` | no |
